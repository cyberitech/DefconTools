# DefconTools
this repo is meant to hold a clone of tools presented at defcon.  While i attended some in the past, it was not until Defcon 31 I got the idea to do this.  Pull requests for tools released at other Defcons 
are welcome.  When submitting pull requests, please ensure the submodule is pegged to a release tag or commit hash that would have been used at that year's Defcon.
